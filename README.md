# Rockbuster-Stealth-LLC

### Introduction

In this project, the goal is to help Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company, with their new online video rental service launch. The company faces tough competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime and plans to utilize their existing movie licenses to stay competitive. As a data analyst hired by Rockbuster Stealth's business intelligence (BI) department, the task is to load all of Rockbuster's data into a relational database management system (RDBMS) and use SQL to analyze the data. The analysis will help answer ad-hoc business questions from various departments, including inventory and customer insights. The results of the analysis will be compiled into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.


### Key Questions and Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?


### Context

In this project, SQL (Structured Query Language) will be used to answer the questions posed by different departments at Rockbuster Stealth LLC. As the project progresses, the complexity of the business questions will increase, and SQL will be leveraged to perform more advanced analyses. The results of the analysis will be presented in a visually appealing format to Rockbuster management, making it easy for them to understand and make data-driven decisions. 

While the data used in this project is from the online video streaming industry, the skills developed through this project can be applied to any industry. The ability to solve problems and perform query-based analyses using SQL is valuable for serving a variety of clients. By the end of the project, the goal is to have gained hands-on experience and proficiency in SQL, enabling the execution of diverse data analyses.


### Data Set

The focus will be on using a data set that includes information about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, payments, and other relevant data. The data set is approximately 3MB in size and consists of several files. Relationships between tables are established when a column name is shared between them. Additionally, you can download both the Rockbuster data set:
